# pkget

`pkget` is a simple CLI tool to help you find, install and manage Go packages.

## Motivation

I was tired of having to search for the full package name when I wanted to do `go get`.
So, I decided to build a simple tool to automate this process.

## Todo

- [ ] create mvp - compare input to predefined list
- [ ] search for packages on pkg.go.dev
- [ ] add list command
- [ ] allow for predefined pkg names to match a file
- [ ] maybe a possible config?
